                        composition is overwhelming students, making them feel frustrated, struggling and discouraged.
                        And reading a large body of text can be difficult to absorb information as they arenât actively
                        learning.<br><br>

                        through film and this can be done through an immersive virtual environment. Having multiple
                        different environments to explore many story possibilities. <em>(beach, indoor, forest, ocean

                        Similar to Crazy 8's and ideation method, I made three ideas in three minutes.<br> Afterwards I
                        went through a design matrices and chose Composition Cicerone.<br> Then I needed to find
                        inspiration and I made a moodboard with images from the internet and made my own colour
                        palette.<br> With that I also designed my cicerone as a statue bust and later on develop it as a
                        muppet to suit a low poly environment.<br> With all this in mind I also made a 3D storyboard to
                        know what my scenes can be:<br> Home Screen, Tutorial/Depth, Leading Lines, Symmetry, Size
                        Equals Power, Break the Rules and Thank you Scene.

                    <p>A prototype is a representation of an envisioned product.
                        Low-fidelity prototyping allows the quick exploration of ideas early in a design process. They
                        can be used to reflect on a design, to discuss design solutions within a team and to get
                        feedback from users through usability testing.</p>
                    <p>I made my low fidelity prototype in <a href="https://glitch.com/"> glitch </a> rather than figma
                        as they give you coding freedom to make a 360 degree environment.<br> I followed Vovakurbatov's

                        <h3><b>User Testing</b></h3>
                        <p> I approached several friends that have never studied film composition and have learnt
                            before. They tested the prototype on their phones and they would walk me through their
                            positive and negative experiences through tasks and interviews. I used <a
                                href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KKEA8cuzJahRq8dwD_leUQIpt3hWF8qP?usp=sharing">Wizard
                                of Oz techniques</a> (accompany with sound) as they interact with the prototype.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>&#9989; Positive Remark</h3>
                        <ul class="tick__list">
                            <li>They found the cicerone dialogue friendly, gentle, cute, clear and upbeat</li>
                            <li>100% of users found it enjoyable and lost their sense of time. They have learnt about
                                composition as it had the right amount of information and wasnât overwhelming this led
                                them to find it useful.</li>
                            <li>The levels they love the most are Donât follow the rules religiously because they
                                âengaging and funny with the random objectsâ and âA nice reminder that some rules can be
                                broken just not all the time, and experiencing those in a first-person pov helped me
                                understand more why some rules can be broken sometimesâ</li>
                            <li>Another level they love is Symmetry because âI like the idea of fixing and making sure
                                things are in the right place. this can be related to the principle of making things
                                look nice through symmetry.â and âone because it had the most interactions.â</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>&#10062; Negative Remark</h3>
                        <ul class="cross__list">
                            <li>For the back view never leave the scene purely white or black as it is a 360 environment
                                and users should explore everything.</li>
                            <li>Need a proper tutorial how to use the Google Cardboard, UI elements (dwelling gaze) and
                                where the menu is (look down at your feet the menu will appear).</li>
                            <li>Need a replay dialogue button, when a player need to re-listen the dialogue.</li>

                    <h3><b>Takeaways From This Project</b></h3>
                    <p class="research__description">
                        Composition Cicerone was a fantastic opportunity to investigate problems in an active learning
                        space, to take a deep dive into 3D design practices and to learn how to iterate designs using a
                        large body of users.
                        <br>
                        Challenges I have faced in this project where the coding bugs. I have learnt to try multiple
                        computers or restarting my computer to let the game run and that would fix it. Patience and
                        determination got all my coding to work.<br>
                        I was grateful to have Henry and Callum guide me to effectively code and understand the visual
                        designs, creating a desireable outcome, and was also grateful to advance my technical skills
                        using Blender, Autodesk Maya, and Unity.

                    <h3><b>Future Works</b></h3>
                    <p class="research__description">
                        Within a month I wish to achieve:

                    <ul class="list">
                        <br>
                        <li>Adding âSize Equals Power Levelâ. A dominating raccoon looming over the player, whilst the
                            player selects a key or ruby to proceed through the level. Clicking any of the two options
                            will lead the racoon to smaller, escaping through the door with one of the two items.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>When the player picks three wrong answers they have maybe a visual clue or the cicerone can
                            give them an audible clue or both in âThe Rule of Thirdsâ level. Also Adding some seashells,
                            sand grass, umbrella, seats, beach towel and palm trees to set the beach scene more, when
                            the user looks to their left or right side.</li><br>
                        <li>Fix the Ciceroneâs left eye. Making sure it doesnât drop to the floor after a minute.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>âDepthâ and âSize Equals Powerâ, room looks exactly the same blue floor and white timber
                            walls. What if these two levels have their own theme. An example of this is a cozy house for
                            a cat owner with plenty of pic- ture frames and a fluffy carpet floor for the âDepthâ Level.
                            While âSize Equals Powerâ would have a wooden plank, a pillow on top and a diamond on top of
                            that to make it look like a heist scene covered with a glass casing. And have the racoon
                            lift the glass lid and stealing the diamond or key. Having a dark environment with lasers.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Make the VR app platform be accessible to both the Android and iPhone. To make accessible to
                            a wide range of audiences.</li><br>
                        <li>The âHomeâ level can be decorated more with cameras and film equipment in the back. lights,
                            cameras, green screen, folders, papers that have storyboards on them and papers with
                            composition lines placed on the table.</li><br>
                        <li>Make a subtitle dark grey box with 80% transparency with white text on top. Rather than my
                            current grey text. And make each line two to four words depending on the word length.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>If there is a way to do background blurs and apertures to give a more sense of depth.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>For âRules of Thirdsâ Cicerone can refer to it as a âtic tac toe boardâ so players can
                            remember the illustration guides easily.</li><br>
                        <li>The Cicerone hands needed to be changed to the left side, so it looks more natural.</li>
                    </ul>
